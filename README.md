# EZTweaks
Windows 10 has a bunch of quirks that still need much adjustments.  
This script is my hopes of finally creating a more usable and stable user experience.

Without going into crazy details, here are the settings that are changed by the script.
---
### Windows Verbose Mode  
This will show all Windows messages during the start up and shutdown process instead of the pretty and unhelpful "Starting Windows" and "Shutting Down" messages.  

### Windows Update Manually  
Take control back for your Windows Updates.  I'm tired of MS always calling the shots on when I update my OS and even worse, rebooting my computer when I have a boatload of work on my desktop then losing it all!

### Windows Animation Timing  
How quickly the animations for menus, minimize and maximize work.  I like it fast.

### Taskbar Show Seconds  
Show seconds in the system clock on the taskbar.

### Stop Windows Update restarting your PC  
Even if Windows does perform an update, this will prevent it from rebooting without permissions so long as you are logged in.

### Startup Delay  
Do you want for Windows to wait before completely loading or just quickly load and be done with?  I say load and be done with.  Why?  Everything I have is on an SSD.  No reason not to.

### RDP CredSSP Fix  
Sometimes when connecting to another machine, you get an encryption error.  This fixes it (sort of).

### Enable PDF preview in Explorer Fix  
Exactly what it says.

### Force Disk Cleanup Delete New Files  
Supposedly Windows cleans up its own temp files.  While I doubt it very much, this tells it how often to do so.

### Disable automatic driver updates in Windows 10  
For some reason drivers that are working fine will no longer work because of this automatic update, so I turned it off.

### Remove Quick Access from Explorer  
In a domain environment, this drives users nuts, so let's turn it off.

### Remove OneDrive  
Useless garbage!

### Hide Hi greeting in Windows 10  
When a new user logs in, this will stop with the nicety crap and get down to the nitty gritty.

### No hide file extensions  
Shows known file extensions.

### Remove 3D objects  
WTF are they for anyway?

### Disable Security Center Notifications  
They can be annoying!

### Task bar preview delay (ms)  
When you point to a running app icon, this determines how long until it shows a preview of the app.

### Disable MS Ads in explorer  
They're always pushing their cloud products, so this makes it stop!

### No Glomming 
Keep every icon on the taskbar separate, not grouped

### Don't add -Shortcut text to the name of newly created shortcuts

### Disable Telemetry in Microsoft Office
No more phone home!

### Don't hide recently opened Programs from the Start menu /Start Run

### Don't hide recently opened Documents from the Start menu /Start Run

### Don't show notifications/adverts (OneDrive & new feature alerts) in Windows Explorer

### Don't change the upper/lower case of filenames automatically
